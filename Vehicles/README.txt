Introduction:
I created spacecrafts (Vehicle) in this project.

Usage:
- The final.unity is the one can be run directly, I have attached the Main.cs to an EmptyObject (you only need to modify the seed to get different vehicles).

Details of my work:
1. All required parts completed
2. My efforts:
    - Used subdivision surface for nearly all surfaces.
    - Two main body parts(wing & tail) of the spacecraft are animated.
    - Two main body parts(wing & tail) of the spacecraft are swappable.
        1. Wing: Designed 3 variations for wing.
        2. Tail: Designed 4 variations for tail.
    - Add texture (steel material) to two types of wing.
    - Make camera moveable.
    - Many parts of the spacecraft shows variation in size(e.g., wings, tails, etc.). 
    - Make smooth joins between tail and body.
